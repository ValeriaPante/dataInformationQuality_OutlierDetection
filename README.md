# Data & Information Quality - Outlier Detection
The assigned task is the analysis of the effect of outlier detection on different classification techniques. In particular, the original dataset was injected with different percentages of outliers (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) and the performances were analyzed on each of them independently, before and after using outlier detection. Given that, for each assigned dataset, different techniques were used based on their diversity. 

In this repository you can find, the two datasets, the notebooks related to each one of them and a detailed report.
